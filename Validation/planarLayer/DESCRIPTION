DESCRIPTION:
These simulations are for checking the correct implementation of Gauss's Law. Three cases for interFoamEHD are set up (conductive-conductive, dielectric-conductive and dielectric-dielectric). Another case is for checking the multiRegion approach.

All simulations contain several run scripts that guide a bit, and almost all have a verification script in Python. There is also a global verification script next to this DESCRIPTION file, which can be run in Matlab after running all validation cases in this directory.

The mesh dependency checks the rate of convergence using a dielectric-dielectric interFoamEHD simulation on multiple resolutions.
